This directory contains patches for running/building Assignments 2
against various versions and configurations of Sakai.

assignment2.patch - This patches changes the current trunk version to 
  SAKAI_VERSION so that it can be adjusted for the version of Sakai.

remove-taggable-functionality-stub-false.patch.txt - This patches several
  *.java files so that the taggable signatures match those of previous
  versions of Sakai, all stubbed out methods return false so it also 
  disables OSP/taggable integration for this version. Institutions wishing
  to use the OSP integration with those versions can manually upgrade 
  their taggable versions and remove this patch.

taggable.patch - This patches the taggable module in situation when we may
  want to download and compile a version of taggable to pre-populate the 
  maven repo.
